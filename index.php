Hello, fellow human beings! I'm super excited to start working on this site. It's been a little while since I've done this, so forgive any mistakes you may find and be sure to let me know about them in the <b>chat box</b> to the left! I'm also wondering what kind of content I should be putting up. I'm planning on making some graphics myself, definitely writing some tutorials (not just about web-related things either!), and all kinds of resources to help your online presense look cute as hell!

If you have any ideas, suggestions, or <i>anything</i> you can think of that you'd like to see here, please let me know! I really want this site to grow, and I can't wait to finally stop being a lazy ass procrastinator and get this website off the ground and running. If things go well, I might even buy my own domain name and make things a little bit more official. Well, I'm off to get more pages together and fill it all up with some content. Thanks for reading and visiting. Each click means a lot to me! <b>â™¥</b>
