Hi! My name is <b>Sydney</b> and I am a mere <b>22</b> years old. I'm currently not enrolled in college, although hopefully I will be soon. I work as a <b>waitress</b> (not much fun but the $$$ is good sometimes) in the horrifyingly hot and boring state of <b>Florida</b>. I dream of getting my degree in web/graphic design and doing this - which is what I've loved for years now - as my career. 
<Br>
<br>
I've made countless websites and blogs over the many years that I've been dabbling in coding and graphic design, but sadly most of them ended up being sad, lonely unfinished projects. I hope that with <b>lushvibes</b> I can break that bad habit of mine and stick to something! 
<br>
<br>
If you play Sims 4, Animal Crossing, or Monster Hunter - we are bound to get along. I'm obsessed with all forms of music (literally, any genre), and I take a few too many naps with my boyfriend <b>Gabriel</b>. I live at home (<i>for now!</i>) with my mom, step-father, brother (<b>11</b>), and sister (<b>15</b>).

It's hard to write about yourself when you don't find yourself very interesting, but if you read all of that, you're one cool person. Leave 'squiddles' in the cbox with a link back to your site and I'll feature you in the blog updates just because you're that cool! ;)
